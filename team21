QUNITA

Hello team, after Quinta created the repository for the team, she created this file for us all to pull, edit and push back. I tried unsuccessfully to 
 pull the file to my locap Repo but this was before I watched the vidoe Prof asked us to watch on Git summary. After watching the video, I saw that 
the command to use is "git clone." I just tried that now and it worked. I am editing the file now and I will push it back for you all to see. Thank you
AARON


Team, I am making my contribution to his file and will push it back to the remote repository. To add to what Aaron stated, after cloning the repositoy it is best to create a branch in your local reposit then edit this file in the branch you created. Once done push it to the remote repository.
